BEFORE INSTALLING THIS, UNDERSTAND ONE THING:
If you install this, its going to be installed for every UE4.26 project you have. 
If you don't want this, your only alternative is to make a separate install of 4.26 that you use for Cavalry or those other projects
This isn't going to damage or bloat your projects, it's just something that I think is worth knowing before installing


INSTRUCTIONS
Find the location where you installed Unreal Engine 4.26.2
Go to Engine then Plugins
Copy the ENTIRE Wwise folder into the Plugins folder
You have completed the installation
